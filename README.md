# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my programs is functional by testing the code in different ways, from functional testing, non functional, decision table testing, etc. Depending on what I am doing for the code, will need a specific way to test it to make sure that the functional use of the code is good. To make sure that it is secure, I would check for vulnerabilities of the code using maven and making sure that the code does not have easy errors to slip into that will allow users to explote the system. I would also make sure that the owner uses a specific server or suggest them one to make sure that the system is secure as well.
