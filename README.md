# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my programs is functional by testing the code in different ways, from functional testing, non functional, decision table testing, etc. Depending on what I am doing for the code, will need a specific way to test it to make sure that the functional use of the code is good. To make sure that it is secure, I would check for vulnerabilities of the code using maven and making sure that the code does not have easy errors to slip into that will allow users to explote the system. I would also make sure that the owner uses a specific server or suggest them one to make sure that the system is secure as well.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I would keep a direct line of contact with the owner who wants specific requirements done to the code. I would ask them questions and make sure that I am doing what he wants the code to do. Keeping communications with the owner will allow time for the owner to build their idea of what they want the code to do and then I would be able to execute it. I would also make psuedocode and show the idea to the owner to see if it is what they want for the code before I start it. I would like the psuedocode to be approved before I begin because, this will allow for less changes to the main code if the owner did not like the way I made the code.

# How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I take it section by section. I make psuedocode, do research to see different techniques of what I want to put in my code, then make one part, test, then make the next part. If I had contact with the owner, I would also contact them to show the psuedocode before I begin coding to see if I need to change my approach to the code.
